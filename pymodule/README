Python module for interfacing with SnortAI. Compile it and install it through

$ python setup.py build
$ [sudo] python setup.py install

You can then access the alerts information captured by Snort simply by writing a
code like the following (also see module.py):

import snortai

alerts = snortai.alerts()

for alert in alerts:
	# Access the information
	print alert.gid, alert.sid, alert.rev

The alert class has the following members:

# id, gid, sid, rev, description, priority, classification, timestamp
# src_addr, dst_addr, src_port, dst_port, latitude, longitude
