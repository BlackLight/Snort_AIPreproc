======================
AVERAGE/HIGH PRIORITY:
======================

- Modules for correlation coefficients
- Code profiling
- Comment all the code!!!
- Neural network for computing k
- Testing more scenarios, making more hyperalert models

=============
LOW PRIORITY:
=============

- Managing clusters for addresses, timestamps (and more?)
- Splitting the distinct subgraphs of the output graph

=====
DONE:
=====

+ PostgreSQL support
+ Regex comp cache
+ Managing hyperalert graph connection inside the alert structure itself
+ Keeping track of all the streams and alerts even after clustered
+ Dynamic cluster_min_size algorithm
+ Add alerts' history serialization to db.c as well
+ Bayesian learning among alerts in alert log
+ Split bayesian correlation out of correlation.c
+ Clustering alerts with time constraints
+ Save clusters and correlations to db
+ Uniformed error messages format
+ Full PostgreSQL support for output db
+ Web interface
+ Function names (private functions with _ or __ ?)
+ Saving packet flows as .pcap
+ Manual alert correlation from the web interface
