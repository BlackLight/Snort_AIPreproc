======================
AVERAGE/HIGH PRIORITY:
======================

- Dynamic cluster_min_size algorithm
- Dynamic k parameter in correlation threshold
- Testing more scenarios, making more hyperalert models
- Bayesian learning among alerts in alert log
- libgc support

=============
LOW PRIORITY:
=============

- Managing clusters for addresses, timestamps (and more?)

=====
DONE:
=====

+ PostgreSQL support
+ Regex comp cache
+ Managing hyperalert graph connection inside the alert structure itself
+ Keeping track of all the streams and alerts even after clustered
